# Heroku Buildpack for Deno

This is the Heroku buildpack for Deno apps.

Web processes must bind to `$PORT`, and only the HTTP protocol is permitted for incoming connections.

The buildpack parse `Procfile` and download all dependencies at push time.The downloaded files are cached.

## Specify a Deno Runtime

To specify your Deno version, you also need a `runtime.txt` file - unless you are using the latest Deno runtime version.
```
$ cat runtime.txt
v1.1.2
```

<!--
## Settings to download all dependencies at deployment time

Create `fetch.ts` to your appâ€™s root directory.
Import the source code that starts the application in `fetch.ts`.

example
```typescript
import {} from "./main.ts";
```

The downloaded files are cached.
